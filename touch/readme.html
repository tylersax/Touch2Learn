Program Description: <br/>

This program serves as a piece of educational software for children between the age of five and seven. Users will first go through six lessons about internal and external parts of a computer. The internal parts covered are the CPU, Power Supply, and Bus System. The external parts covered are the speakers, microphone, and webcam. In each lesson, the computer part is compared to a  body part. Afterwards, the user takes a quiz on what he learned. At the end, the user has the option of sharing his scores with others.

Program Applications: <br/>

This program is applicable both in the context of computer science and biology lessons. It simultaneously teaches children about different computer hardware while equating it with body parts. Since the quizzes incorporate both placing body parts on a computer and pairing computer parts with locations on the body, it helps solidifies both systems. In addition, as this program is an Android application, it familiarizes young children with a mobile form of technology that is becoming more prevalent.
